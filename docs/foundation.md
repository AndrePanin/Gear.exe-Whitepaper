While **Gear Technologies** are core contributors to the **Gear** protocol, the *Gear Foundation* is an independent company intended to fund and support the development and growth of the **Gear** network. 

The *Gear Foundation*’s mission is to lower the barrier to entry for blockchain development, to introduce an entirely new pool of talented developers to the Web3 and blockchain industry, onboarding them to the innovative and interoperable Polkadot ecosystem. We hope that this will spur adoption and growth of the blockchain technology, unleashing the potential of the next evolution of the internet - Web3.

To facilitate the growth of the ecosystem and the ease of access to the **Gear** platform, its internal utility token should be listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges. For this purpose, token distribution events will likely be held, which will be handled by the *Gear Foundation* team.

*Gear Foundation* wants to support projects that will add value to Gear’s ecosystem. Projects will have the ability to contribute and influence Gear’s growth by joining the Grants Program. It will ensure access to benefits that can potentially significantly impact these project’s growth and development. Projects that join the program will receive access to funding, developer tools, end-to-end support and a network of developers and venture capitals throughout the industry.

Another initiative set up by *Gear Foundation* is the **Gear** Ambassador program. It is intended to enable individuals from the Gear community to become official partners in expanding the **Gear** ecosystem. The main goal of the ambassador program is to generate awareness and expand Gear’s community by rewarding those who participate. This includes producing original content like videos and articles, organizing and hosting events both online and in-person, contributing to technical documentation, translating existing material, and moderating community platforms by answering questions on Discord or partaking in conversations on platforms like Telegram.

Moreover, the *Gear Foundation* strongly encourages collaboration and partnership with existing projects written on different frameworks and running on other networks. It is expected to be effortless with minimal re-implementation of the existing smart contracts due to a simple and understandable framework.
