Once fully deployed, the **Gear** network will be fully governed by token owners. **Gear** is completely open-source. Vast majority of the tokens will be held by the community and incentivized team. Gear will have a staking mechanism, so running a node will also be incentivized.

`Tokenomics - TBD`
