Once fully deployed, a **Gear Network** will be fully governed by token holders. **Gear** is completely open-source. Vast majority of the tokens will be held by the community and incentivized team. A **Gear Network** will have a staking mechanism, so running a node will also be incentivized.

`Tokenomics - TBD`
